            <p>Though research does say women have more edge than men to be sensitive but there are not many research studies to support this. Some men can be equally or more sensitive then women, It really depends person to person. There are also cultural perspectives and pressures which force men to not to be comfortable showing emotions and sensitivity so therefore men feel obliged to hide thier emotions and senstivities.</p>

            <p>The definition of strength can be looked at from different perspectives. Strength is not merely physical but also mental, social and emotional.
               Although Men do have 20% more advantage when it comes to physical strength but that does not mean women cannot workout, take care of their 
               bodies and be strong. DON‚ÄôT let anyone tell you, you are not strong enough. You can achieve anything you want, just believe in yourself!!  
               Also there is NO evidence that men are socially, mentally and emotionally stronger than women. In fact women are found to be more emotionally 
               intelligent then men according to the many current literature finds. </p>

            <p>According to many studies there are NO gender differences in math ability in young boys and girls. The reason that we see more participations of boys in math and STEM related subjects is because of the cultural gender expectations and the physical environment they are influenced by. Boys are often talked to go towards STEM fields where as girls towards Humanities.</p>

Beauty is a matter of perspective and everyone is beautiful in their own way. The skin colour or weight of your body does not determine your appeal.  I believe real beauty and appeal is when you love yourself. </p>

            <p>We often see that men in the house are working and earning money and women are responsible for the household. This is because of the cultural traditions passing on since centuries. These traditions however do not depict the capability of genders, Women can be natural leaders and there are women who are CEO‚Äôs of big corporations. There are other reasons why we don‚Äôt see as many women in big positions in the corporate sector like women are often discriminated and our judged not on their capability but stereotypes like ‚Äúwomen can‚Äôt make firm decisions‚Äù, ‚ÄúThey cannot analyse situations as good as men‚Äù. These obviously are not true, they are just stereotypes. There are many studies which showcase that typical women nature and quality can be recognized and be used as leadership skills.

At the other side men or boys who are comfortable with women making decisions are called simps, henpecked husbands/boyfriends  and are looked down upon and in fact should be equally respected. </p>
